Interpretation:
The human ACE2 sequence is most closely related to the cat ACE2 sequence. There are 85.2% identical amino acids in the human and cat sequence, 82.1% in human and mouse and 81.7% in cat and mouse. Thus, the human and the cat ACE2 proteins are evolutionarily more closely related. We can predict a closer kinship between human and cat ancestors.
